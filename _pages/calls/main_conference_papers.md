Upon discussion with the ARR and the EACL 2026 chairs, we have agreed to allow early submissions to ACL 2026 in the October ARR cycle to help with potential visa delays. This means that work that is ready to submit to ARR in October and which the authors would like to potentially commit to ACL 2026 can receive an early invitation letter to the conference. Note that this is not a guarantee that the paper would be accepted. Also, work that is very preliminary should not be submitted in this way as it risks rejection and barring from the January cycle, as per the [ARR CFP rules](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp).

ACL 2026 will thus be using both the **October** and **January ARR cycles** with visa letters being issued early upon submission, when necessary.
