## About the Student Research Workshop

The ACL 2026 Student Research Workshop (SRW) is a forum to bring together students investigating various areas of Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for participants to present their work and to receive mentorship and valuable feedback from the international research community. The workshop’s goal is to aid students at multiple stages of their education, including highschool, undergraduate, MSc/MA, junior and senior PhD students, in getting familiar with conducting and presenting their research.

Check our [website](https://acl2026-srw.github.io/) and follow us on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/ACL_SRW_2026) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/acl2026srw.bsky.social) for the latest updates! To contact the organizers of the workshop, please email us at: [acl2026srwchairs@gmail.com](mailto:acl2026srwchairs@gmail.com).


## Call for Papers

We invite papers in two different categories:
 - **Thesis Proposals:** This category is appropriate for Masters/PhD students who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to get feedback on their proposal and broader ideas for their continuing work.
 - **Research Papers:** Papers in this category can describe completed work, or work in progress with preliminary results. For these papers, the first author MUST BE a current student. Topics of interest for the SRW are the same as for the main ACL 2026 conference.

Submissions (in both categories) may be archival or non-archival, based on the wish of the authors. All archival papers will be published in the ACL 2026 SRW Proceedings. Non-archival papers may be submitted to any venue in the future except for another SRW. 

All accepted papers and thesis proposals will be presented either as oral presentations or during poster sessions, which will give students an opportunity to interact with and to present their work to a large and diverse audience, including top researchers in the field and assigned mentors.


## Pre-Submission Mentorship Program

The SRW offers students the opportunity to receive feedback prior to submitting their work for review. The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality and presentation of the student’s work. Participation is optional but encouraged. The pre-submission mentorship is anonymous.

Students wishing to participate in the pre-submission mentorship must submit their paper draft in this [OpenReview website](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2026/SRW_Pre-submission_Mentorship) by February 4, 2026.

The paper needs to be anonymized and follow the same formatting guidelines for the actual submission. Papers can include an additional optional page of questions to mentors. The submission will be assigned a mentor who will review and will provide feedback within February 25, 2026. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission. The feedback will be in the form of suggestions, which can be incorporated before the actual submission deadline.

You CAN submit a paper at the SRW submission deadline even if you did not participate in the pre-submission mentoring. If you did submit a draft for pre-submission mentoring, you will need to make a new submission for the final version of the paper.

## Submission Requirements

We accept both archival submissions (which will be included in the conference proceedings) and non-archival submissions (which will be presented at the workshop but will not be included in the proceedings).

Long papers consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus an unlimited number of pages for references and supplementary material like the appendix. Upon acceptance, papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages).

Short papers consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus an unlimited number of pages for references and supplementary material like the appendix. Upon acceptance, papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages).

Thesis proposals consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited references. The title must begin with “Thesis Proposal:”. Upon acceptance, they will be given nine (9) content pages in the proceedings. 

Authors are encouraged to use the additional page to address reviewers’ comments. Paper submissions must use the official ACL style templates, which are available as an [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/crtcwgxzjskr) and also a [direct download](https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB/tree/master/templates) (Late). We strongly encourage participants to use the Latex template. All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the official style guidelines, which are contained in these template files. The review process will be double-blind, and thus all submissions must be anonymized. The SRW invites papers on topics related to computational linguistics, including but not limited to the following:
 - Computational Social Science and Social Media
 - Dialogue and Interactive Systems
 - Discourse and Pragmatics
 - Ethics and NLP
 - Information Extraction
 - Information Retrieval and Text Mining
 - Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP
 - Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics, and Beyond
 - Large Language Models
 - Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling, and Psycholinguistics
 - Machine Learning for NLP
 - Machine Translation and Multilinguality
 - NLP Applications
 - Phonology, Morphology, and Word Segmentation
 - Question Answering
 - Resources and Evaluation
 - Semantics: Lexical
 - Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual - Inference, and Other Areas
 - Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining
 - Speech and Multimodality
 - Summarization
 - Syntax: Tagging, Chunking, and Parsing
 - Thesis Proposals

 
## Limitations (required section)

Authors are required to discuss the limitations of their work in a dedicated section titled “Limitations”. This section should be included at the end of the paper, before the references, and it will not count toward the page limit. This includes both, long and short papers. Papers without a limitations section will be desk rejected. Please note that this section should not introduce new methods, analysis, or results. We reserve the right to desk reject the submissions that use this section to introduce more content that should have been part of the main paper. It can only discuss the limitations of the work presented in the main content of the paper.


## How to Submit

There are two routes for paper submission:

**Direct submission:** Papers should be submitted through openreview using the following link: <https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2026/SRW_Direct_Submission>. Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.

**ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers:** Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to ACL 2026. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews. ARR papers should be committed through openreview using the following link: <https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2026/SRW_ARR_Commitment>. When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.


## Grants

We expect to have grants to offset some portion of students’ travel, conference registration, and accommodation expenses. Further details will be posted on the SRW website.
