## Membership Policy

The ACL policy is that everyone attending an ACL conference must be a current (CY 2026) ACL member. So, in addition to the registration fee, each Regular will add $100 membership fee to their registration and each Student will add $50 membership fee to their registration if not already a 2026 paid member. Your ACL membership is for the entire calendar year, providing membership in the society devoted to promoting CL research throughout the world, open access to the CL and TACL Journals and ACL Anthology as well as access to other ACL conferences in the same year without paying membership again. Membership also entitles you to electronic notification of new issues of the journals, discounts on publications from participating publishers, announcements of ACL and related conferences, workshops, and journal calls of interest to the community.
